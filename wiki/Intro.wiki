= Introduction =

Am going to collect all the small or bigger extension I create for Spring here in this project. Have already done a few and are planning to to more.



= Details =

Have already done (and are used in a real system that processes alot of data)
  * Thread Scope
  * Fluent Insert/Update (see [https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-5238 Jira-SPR-523])

Planned in a near future 
  * OXM namespace overriding support for JaxB/Castor (and more if they support it). See [https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-6503 Jira-SPR-6503]

Planned in a NOT so near future
  * Using [http://code.google.com/p/protobuf Google Protobuffer] as an OXM marchaller. If this even can be done it would be really cool. A "web-service" that performs better than a RMI call.
